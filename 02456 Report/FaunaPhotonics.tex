\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Automated, non-destructive insect detection in fields can improve pest control and spare beneficial insects in crops\cite{Kirkeby2021}.
The FaunaPhotonics insect sensor\cite{rydhmer2021automating}, the Volito, can detect insects by near-infrared (NIR) back-scatter.
The data provided by a Volito can be classified as insects, or not insects. 

The challenge is to do so reliably and quickly.

The Volito emits NIR and detects back-scatter using a charge-coupled device (CCD) sensor.
NIR back-scatters off an insect's carapace and wings as specular and diffuse reflections.
The reflections and wing beat frequency (WBF) produce a signature of the insect, that a deep neural network can be trained to identify and classify.
The CCD is sampled at $\sim$20KHz and produces a waveform when an insect traverses the probe volume, that is very similar to an audio signal a given insect produces, when flying. 
For a farmer to map insect prevalence in a field, the sensor must be mounted on a moving platform, e.g.\ a tractor or spraying boom.
When the sensor is in motion, significant noise is introduced in the acquired signal, e.g. from equipment vibration, crops traversing the probe volume etc.
The classification of insects need to be real-time such that the spraying boom can spray detected insects, while holding off in areas without activity.
This requires that our classification network be very robust to e.g.\ noise, rapid changes in baseline and vibration, while classifying real-time.
