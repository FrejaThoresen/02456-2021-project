    abstract = "{During flight, insect wings bend and twist under the influence of aerodynamic and inertial forces. We tested whether wing resonance of honeybees (Apis mellifera) matches the wingbeat frequency, against the ‘stiff element’ hypothesis that the wing's first longitudinal mode exceeds the wingbeat frequency. Six bees were immobilized with their right wing pair outspread, and stimulated with a shaker while the normal modes were recorded with a scanning Doppler laser vibrometer. The lowest normal mode of the wings was the first longitudinal bending mode and, at 602±145 Hz, was greater than the wingbeat frequency of 234±13.9 Hz. Higher-order normal modes of the wing tended to incorporate nodal lines in the chordwise direction of the trailing edge, suggesting that their mode shape did not strongly resemble wing deformation during flapping flight. These results support the stiff element hypothesis for Apis mellifera.}",

abstract = {Abstract We propose an ensemble of long–short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks for intraday stock predictions, using a large variety of technical analysis indicators as network inputs. The proposed ensemble operates in an online way, weighting the individual models proportionally to their recent performance, which allows us to deal with possible nonstationarities in an innovative way. The performance of the models is measured by area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic. We evaluate the predictive power of our model on several US large-cap stocks and benchmark it against lasso and ridge logistic classifiers. The proposed model is found to perform better than the benchmark models or equally weighted ensembles.},
